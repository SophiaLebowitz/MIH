      <h1> Mandatory Inclusionary Housing in Brooklyn Does Little for the Rent Burdened </h1>

      <p> Sunset Park is in the middle of a rezoning fight, Totem, a Brooklyn based developer wants to turn this Dunkin Doughnuts into a mixed use apartment building with 35 permanently affordable units using MIH guidelines.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> Mandatory Inclusionary Housing, MIH, was created by Mayor De Blasio in 2016 as a part of his Housing New York plan. The plan’s objective was to “require through zoning actions a share of new housing to be permanently affordable,” according
        to <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/mih/mandatory-inclusionary-housing.page"> New York City’s Department of Planning</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> The affordability of the units is determined by the Average Median Income (AMI) of the entire city, which is currently about $100,000 for a family of four.
      </p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p> David Estrada, former chief of staff for Council Member Carlos Menchaca and current director of the Sunset Park 5th Ave. BID, said “MIH is a broken system, fixing it would take 3-10 years.”There were only two community districts in Brooklyn
        with a median income of over $100,000 last year. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Some community members don’t want to settle for a new development that has any less than 100% affordable housing. Estrada said he thinks this project, considering our current system, wouldn’t do any harm, “we don't want anything until we get
        everything? That’s no way to run a city.” </p>
